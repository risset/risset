## Welcome!

I'm a Platform Engineer focused on developer experience. Most of my
work has involved building tools in Go to automate and solve problems
around the SDLC process. I've just started a
[blog](https://liamwyllie.net) where I'll be writing posts about
various technical topics, such as Nix, OCI containers and the Go
language :)
